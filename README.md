# SpeedReader



The brain is able to process words faster when we dont have to move our eyes. So this program was started to allow a person to read texts faster. There is an associated text file that the content the user wants to read is posted into. The program will then pull from that document to display one word at a time on the screen in a specified rate of words per minute. 

Several features need to be added for functionality including:
-a pause button to start and stop program
- ability to change speeds
- ability to read screens/webpages rather than imported text
- allow the text to be imported via gui
- ability to adjust font, font size, font color
- full screen capability
